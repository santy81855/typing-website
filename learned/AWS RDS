# Create and connect AWS RDS postgres

### Step 1: Create RDS instance

-   Important values:
    -   allow public access
    -   Edit VPC Security groups to allow Custom TCP traffic on the database port from any IPv4 and IPv6 addresses

### Step 2: Get the DATABASE_URL

-   The database url goes in the .env file and should follow the following format:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/NAME?connect_timeout=30"
```

The "connect_timeout=30" is optional, but sometimes with RDS the connection can time out.
